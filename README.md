AMD 3D CPU cache rudimentary implementation cannot overcome electron turbulence due to 3d intersection of electrostatic forces and gravity. It speaks to a fundamental underpinning of the physical universe, and it's semi-intuitive. Gravity and electricity interactions between electrons cross and the interaction is strange. Makes for micro noise.

I think there is something to a 3d arrangement of wires vs 2d where gravity, pressure, and joint 3d electron forces come together with clock speed fluctuations to produce electron adeterminism

Present AMD software solution to above utilizing machine learning only functions at low clock and/or power

Theory: 3D cache notoriously difficult to do right, insiders w/ physx knowledge aware. When gravity and electrostatic forces intersect, electron motion becomes dysfluid; the consequence is micro noise. Solution requires synchronous SDRAM (inherently more noise resistant) and iron.

Transistor downsizing means introduction of further noise as thermal fluctuations at set power x frequency combos determine noise. 
Additionally, basic theory is where electricity and gravity intersect, electron dysfluidity manifests. Ensures challenge with implementation of 3D cache.

Async RAM in AMD implementation of 3d cache where Intel pursuing sdram solution, just a conclusion based on googled and remembered sdram mixed with CPU fundaments without having read that Intel 3d tech is confirmed going to use sdram

The main argument is that electrons interfere with other electrons when stacked
 
 
Electrons move differently and acquire partial charges differently across pressure differences crossed with interactions between conductor levels.
 
This amounts to dysfluid electron motion and consequently micro noise in the system.
 
When conducting elements are stacked vertically, electron turbulence manifests.

I cannot overstate how out of this world magical it was to experience some strange existence where I felt stuck between 14, 15, 16 for a week of early February as some strange incidences occurred through and/or throughout my brain.
 
4. I derived quantum intuition while massively high on dihexa + tb5:
 
The tendency of particles to exist in a state is influenced by the state they've been in for a time, sort of like muscle memory oh because strings change shape
 
If time is emergent then duration at temp is relevant
 
Time travels differentially with respect to speed, so there is a relationship between the 2
 
Time across energy is a dimension
 
It's like angular momentum with strings
 
5. I refined with above and inducted deducted the following:
 
Pressure differences across levels of a CPU mean inconsistent electron determinism
 
Memory of past state is fundamentally different at different pressures
 
Do electrons interface with one another where there is pressure difference?

The electronic space is between 2 and 3 D

The science is over my head frankly, probably a sweet spot to attaining frequency, multiprocessing, power loading and cache coordination. Try looking at comparison benchmarks with the naked eye - I think this stuff is fascinating.
